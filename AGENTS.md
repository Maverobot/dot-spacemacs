## Guidelines
* Emphasize modularity and maintainability.
* Test-driven development.
* Use `DECISIONS.md` for documenting the decision making process behind important code structure, architecture, and implementation choices.
* When working with markdown files, do not use two trailing spaces at the end of lines for line breaks. Use a single line break instead.
* ALWAYS USE THE QUESTION TOOL IF YOU NEED TO ASK USER.
* USE THE QUESTION TOOL TO ASK FOR FEEDBACK OR NEXT STEPS WHENEVER THE CURRENT TASK IS COMPLETE OR BLOCKED.

## Environments
* The config should work both for linux and MacOS.

## Progress Tracking
* **Always** check `PROGRESS.md` at the start of each session to understand current work status.
* **Always** update `PROGRESS.md` when starting or completing significant work.
* Commit progress updates regularly to avoid losing session information.
* Use the "Session Notes" section to document decisions made during the session.
